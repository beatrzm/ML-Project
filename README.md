Machine Learning Project from the course at TÃ©cnico. For each part we were asked to build a model and predict a test set, the predictions were evaluated on a certain metric by the professors
and the groups were ranked. In the report we were asked to explain our reasoning and show different model's outcomes. The final grade was comprised of both the report and rankings. 
With this project we obtained a 19.8/20
